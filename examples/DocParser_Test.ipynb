Token constraints are boolean expressions over various attributes of a token (e.g., [word_{pred}_{:}_{prezetel}  tag_{noun}]). Syntax queries describe traversals over the syntax graph. For example, the query John nsubj eats dobj [1] would find John , traverse an incoming subj edge to eats , then traverse an outgoing doj] edge to any other token.

Consider this contextualized causal pattern: ( ?cause [1]) leads to ( ?effect [1] nmod_during ( ?context [1]). Here, in the same pattern the user can specify sequences of lexical elements (i.e., leads to) along with syntactic graph traversals (i.e., nmod_during).text 12572273362325.1. Event Queries1 text257235455265Odinson also supports event queries, which make it easier to specify complex patterns involving many entities interacting through a trigger. In particular, each event query is a structured query that contain several sub-queries: one for the event trigger, and one for each of the required arguments. Additionally, the structure of the query provides opportunities for further optimization.text text257267455323Additionally, the structure of the query provides opportunities for further optimization. If all these queries match, only then is the graph deserialized and checked to make sure that the required arguments are connected to the trigger in the specified way. Event queries can also include arguments that are not required to match, but which are included in the result if they do (i.e., optional arguments). For example, consider this event query shown in Rule 1:text text257333455352and Too] must have been found in advance. However, for several use cases it is desirable to match patterns in a topdown manner, i.e., first identifying events of interest andtext text257359455376The first, i.e. Food dobj), then by default Odinons matches the single token at the end of the path.text text257379455391(d) Two instrument arguments are matched.text text257400455441Figure 5: Example sentence illustrating the results of applying the Rules 1  2 given in Section 5.1. (a) The Odinson index contains many token and relation annotations as a basis for capture patterns. (b) The event trigger is a token pattern, that if matched, becomes the anchor for the argument patterns. The trigger rule matches here because the lemma of ate is eat. (c) The system matches the required argument theme, which asserts that there must be a direct object dependency link between the trigger and a noun phrase (here, as found by a chunker and encoded in the BIO notation). Both the trigger and the required arguments must match in order to extract the event as a whole.text text257443455471(e) The first, i.e., incoming or outgoing) is chosen based on the direction of the dependency.

When applied to the sentence Audrey ate ramen with chopsticks and a spoon, Odinson will extract an event with one theme and two instruments, as shown in Figure 5.text text257322455352In the rule above, all of the referenced mentions (i.e., Food and Too] must have been found in advance. However, for several use cases it is desirable to match patterns in a topdown manner, i.e., first identifying events of interest andtext 257353445380257387455410While Odinson already provides a declarative language readily available for end users, the query compiler was designed to decouple the rule language from the specific low level operations that need to be performed on the index through the use of an intermediate representation. This allows different languages to target Odinsons intermediate representations and take advantage of the compiler to generate highly efficient queries that can be used in the Odin-on framework. Further, our compiler performs several optimizations on the query to greatly improve its efficiency. 7text 1604622274696. Query Compilation and Execution1 text47474243485Once a user has provided a query in our declarative language, Odinson complies and executes it. For runtime optimization, Odinson aims to index as much as possible, buttext text47490243510not everything can be indexed. For this reason, we use a multi-step, tiered execution of queries. Queries which do not involve syntax are compiled into an index query and matched against the inverted index only (recall Figure 3).text text47512243548Queries which do involve syntax are compiled into both an index query as well as a graph traversal pattern. However, the latter is only executed if the former matches. To help explain these representations, as well as the tiered query execution, consider the query and three sentences shown in Figure 6 alongside the detailed explanations below:text text257421455457Index query: For the user query shown in Figure 6, pretzels nsubj xcomp thirsty , the compiler builds an index query by collapsing the beginning of the graph traversal (i.e., nsubj) to the adjacent word (pretzels ), where the token field (i.e., incoming or outgoing) is chosen based on the direction of the dependency.

(a) The Odinson index contains many token and relation annotations as a basis for capture patterns. (b) The event trigger is a token pattern, that if matched, becomes the anchor for the argument patterns. The trigger rule matches here because the lemma of ate is eat. (c) The system matches the required argument theme, which asserts that there must be a direct object dependency link between the trigger and a noun phrase (here, as found by a chunker and encoded in the BIO notation). Both the trigger and the required arguments must match in order to extract the event as a whole.text\",\n",

Token constraints are boolean expressions over various attributes of a token (e.g., [word_{pred}_{:}_{prezetel}  tag_{noun}). Syn-tax queries describe traversals over the syntax graph. For example, the query John nsubj eats dobj [1] would find John , traverse an incoming subj edge to any other token. By surrounding part of a query with ?argument_name... , the tokens can be captured as named arguments. For example, modifying the previous query to ( ?agent ) John nsubj eats dobj [1] would capture John as the agent.text\",\n",

This allows different languages to target Odinsons intermediate representations and take advantage of the compiler to generate highly efficient queries that can be used in the Odin-on framework.
